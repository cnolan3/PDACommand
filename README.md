# clex
An example attempt to write a lexical and syntax analysis program.

## usage
From clex/ directory run `./scripts/build.sh` to build, you'll need to 
have cmake, make and g++ installed.

You may need to run `chmod +x scripts/*` before using the build script.

All of the scripts in the scripts/ directory are meant to be called from 
within clex/, not from clex/scripts/.

The program executable will be in clex/build/bin/ and is named pda.
